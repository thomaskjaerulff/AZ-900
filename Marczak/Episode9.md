# Compute Services | VMs, VM Scale Set, App Service, Functions, ACI, AKS

## Virtualization
- Emulation of physical machines
- Different virtual hardware configuration per machine/app
- Different operating systems per machine/app
- Total separation of environments
    - file systems,
    - services,
    - ports,
    - middleware,
    - configuration

## Virtual Machines
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Total control over the operating system and the software
- Supports marketplace and custom images
- Best suited for
    - Custom software requiring custom system configuration
    - Lift-and-shift scenarios
- Can run any application/scenario
    - web apps & web services,
    - databases,
    - desktop applications,
    - jumpboxes,
    - gateways, etc.

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Set of identical virtual machines
- Built-in auto scaling features
- Designed for manual and auto-scaled workloads like web services,* batch processing, etc.

## Containers
- Use host’s operating system
- Emulate operating system (VMs emulate hardware)
- Lightweight (no O/S)
    - Development Effort
    - Maintenance
    - Compute & storage requirements
- Respond quicker to demand changes
- Designed for almost any scenario

## Azure Container Instances
- Simplest and fastest way to run a container in Azure
- Platform as a Service
- Serverless Containers
- Designed for
    - Small and simple web apps/services
    - Background jobs
    - Scheduled scripts

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Open-source container orchestration platform
- Platform as a Service
- Highly scalable and customizable
- Designed for high scale container deployments (anything really!)

## App Service
- Designed as enterprise grade web application service
- Platform as a Service
- Supports multiple programming languages and containers

## Azure Functions (Function Apps)
- Platform as a Service
- Serverless
- Two hosting/pricing models
    - Consumption-based plan
    - Dedicated plan
- Designed for micro/nano-services

## Summary
- Virtual Machines (IaaS) - Custom software, custom requirements, very specialized, high - - - degree of control
- VM Scale Sets (IaaS) - Auto-scaled workloads for VMs
- Container Instances (PaaS) - Simple container hosting, easy to start
- Kubernetes Service (PaaS) - Highly scalable and customizable * container hosting platform
- App Services (PaaS) - Web applications, a lot of enterprise web * hosting features, easy to start
- Functions (PaaS) (Function as a Service) (Serverless) - micro/nano-services, excellent - - - consumption-based pricing, easy to start
