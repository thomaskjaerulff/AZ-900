# Azure Solutions
## Internet of Things (IoT)
- Internet of Things (IoT) describes connected devices equipped with sensors that collect data and sends that data to an endpoint for logging, processing, and/or other actions.

- Azure includes several services that enable organizations to integrate IoT devices quickly and easily and deploy solutions based on IoT.

### Azure IoT Hub
- Azure IoT Hub is an Azure-hosted service that functions as a message hub for bidirectional communication between your deployed IoT devices and Azure services.

### Azure IoT Central
- Azure IoT Central builds on the functions provided by IoT Hub to provide visualization, control and management features for IoT devices. 

### Azure Sphere
- Azure Sphere is an integrated IoT solution that consists of three key parts: 
    - Azure Sphere micro-controller units (MCUs)
    - Management software
    - Azure Sphere Security Service (AS3)

## Artificial Intelligence
- AI falls into two broad categories: deep learning and machine learning.

- Deep learning uses a system modeled on the human mind to enable the service to discover information, learn, and grow.

- Machine learning is a data science technique that uses data to train a data model, test the model for relative accuracy, and then apply the model to new data.

### Azure Machine Learning
- Azure Machine Learning consists of a collection of Azure services and tools that enable you to use data to train and validate models.

- Azure Machine Learning encompasses multiple services and features to support your AI development efforts. For example, Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web portal through which developers can create no-code and code-first solutions using a selection of tools, including drag-and-drop model design. You can also use Machine Learning Studio to manage assets and resources, publish your models as web services. 

### Azure Cognitive Services
- Azure Cognitive Services provides machine learning models designed to interact with humans and execute cognitive functions that humans would normally do, such as recognizing images.

- Azure Cognitive Services consists of the following: 
    - Language
    - Speech
    - Vision
    - Decision

### Azure Bot Service
- Azure Bot Service enables you to create and use virtual agents to interact with users by answering questions, gathering information, and potentially initiating activities through other Azure services.

- Can support Azure Cognitive Services. 

## Serverless Computing
- Serverless computing enables you to run code without deploying and managing a server to host and run that code. 

- Azure offers two primary serverless computing services, Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps. 

### Azure Functions
- The Azure Functions service enables you to host a single method or function that runs in response to an event such as a queued message, HTTP request, or timer event. 

- Azure Functions service scales automatically, enabling your function to scale to meet changes in demand without any interaction or configuration by your developers.

-  Azure function is stateless, meaning it does not store its state from execution to execution.

### Azure Logic Apps
- Logic Apps enables you to create no-code and low-code solutions hosted in Azure to automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows. 

- You build Logic Apps using a web-based design environment.

## DevOps
- The term DevOps describes process, practices, and services designed to integrate development and IT with the end goal of simplifying and streamlining development efforts while maintaining high quality.

### Azure DevOps Services
- Azure DevOps is a group of services designed to enable and support development at multiple stages in the development process: 
    - Azure Artifacts
    - Azure Boards
    - Azure Pipelines
    - Azure Repos
    - Azure Test Plans

### GitHub and GitHub Actions
- GitHub is a popular code repository for open source software that enables code sharing, development collaboration, review and discussion, documentation, and other collaboration mechanisms for sharing and collaborating on open source code projects.

- GitHub Actions provides workflow automation services.

### Azure DevTest Labs
- Azure DevTest Labs automates the deployment, configuration, and decommissioning of virtual machines and other Azure resources. 

- DevTest Labs can use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to deploy nearly any type of Azure resource.
