# Cloud Concepts

## Understanding Cloud Computing
- Microsoft Cloud offerings enable organizations to eliminate computing infrastructure that they might normally host themeselves. 

- Microsoft owns and maintaines numerous data centers around the world.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
### Economic Benefits
- Capital expenditure (CapEx) is money spent by an organization to acquire fixed assets. 

- Azure handles the capital expenditure (CapEx) and replaces them with the operational expenditures (OpEx) which are expenditures to run its operation. 

- Instead of incurring a relatively large up-front cost, Azure spreads out the cost on a monthly basis for an organization. 

- Move from CapEx to OpEx eliminates a very large up-front cost. 

- Economy of scale is when a cloud provider can purchase a large amount of hardware at a discount. 

### Scalability and Elasticity
- Scalability is the ability to add computing resources to adjust to increased demand. 

- Scaling out your services means adding additional ones to meet demands.

- Scaling up means adjusting capacity in existing resources to meet demands. 

- Automatic scaling is called Elasticity, and enables Azure to scale resources without interaction. 

### High Availability
- High Availability describes a system that is available for use without significant outages and that is generally backed by a service level agreement. 

### Fault Tolerance
- Fault tolerance is a characteristic that enables it to continue functioning when one or more components of the system fails. 

- Fault tolerance generally comes into play when a single resource fails. 

### Disaster Recovery
- Disaster recovery refers to the process of recovering from a situation where multiple systems or services fail.

- There is no right answer for a disaster recovery strategy, and it is very much situational and tied to you business continuity needs and defined by the IT services you provide. 

## Financial Models
Moving to a cloud solution that is paid for 
via a monthly subscription service based on consumption represents a shift to an operational 
expense. This shift from capital to operational can mean a huge savings for an organization, 
as well as greater flexibility and agility

 If you purchase the hardware 
yourself, you incur the cost whether or not those servers are ever operational.

## Cloud Computing Models and Responsibilities
Azure provides three cloud computing models: 

### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- SaaS is a licensing model in which an organization licenses software on a subscription basis from a provider that centrally manages and distributes the software.

- Beneficial because you are moving away from a CapEx model to an OpEx model.

- Beneficial because it provides automatic updates without additional cost.

- Beneficial because you do not need to deploy or manage software. 

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
- IaaS enables you to deploy and use infrastructure components in Azure.

- advantage of this solution is that you donâ€™t incur a capital expenditure for the hardware or for the operating system licenses. You also only incur operational costs when the servers are running.

- Another benefit is scalability. Easy to add resource (vertical- and horizontal scaling)

- IaaS generally has a higher shared responsibility than SaaS. Although Microsoft manages the hardware that supports your virtualized infrastructure, you still need to manage the virtual servers, operating systems, and applications installed on the virtual machines. 

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
- PaaS is a combination of IaaS and SaaS in that it incorporates both infrastructure and software. An example is virtualization. 

- Think of PaaS as the capability to develop and deploy web-based applications without the need to manage the underlying servers, OS's, etc.

### Shared Responsibility
In an on-premises IT scenario, your organization is responsible for all aspects of the service. 
With cloud computing, you have a shared responsibility with the cloud provider. 

Each category of cloud computing (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS) in Azure involves different levels of responsibility from your organization and Microsoft.

## Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud Models

### Public Cloud
A public cloud is one in which the services offered in the cloud are available for public use over the Internet. 

### Private Cloud
A private cloud is one in which the cloud serves a single organization, whether hosted in your own data center or by someone else. A private cloud offers many of the same benefits of scalability, elasticity, and other aspects of a public cloud.
Many organizations have regulatory requirements to prevent certain types of data from being exposed to the Internet, and hosting that data in a private cloud can help that organization meet that requirement.

### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is one in which an organization integrates on-premises services with cloud hosted services, whether in a public or a private cloud.e
