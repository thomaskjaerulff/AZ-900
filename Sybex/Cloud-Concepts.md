# Cloud Concepts

## Understanding Cloud Computing
- Microsoft Cloud offerings enable organizations to eliminate computing infrastructure that they might normally host themeselves. 

- Microsoft owns and maintaines numerous data centers around the world.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
### Economic Benefits
- Capital expenditure (CapEx) is money spent by an organization to acquire fixed assets. 

- Azure handles the capital expenditure (CapEx) and replaces them with the operational expenditures (OpEx) which are expenditures to run its operation. 

- Instead of incurring a relatively large up-front cost, Azure spreads out the cost on a monthly basis for an organization. 

- Move from CapEx to OpEx eliminates a very large up-front cost. 

- Economy of scale is when a cloud provider can purchase a large amount of hardware at a discount. 

### Scalability and Elasticity
- Scalability is the ability to add computing resources to adjust to increased demand. 

- Scaling out your services means adding additional ones to meet demands.

- Scaling up means adjusting capacity in existing resources to meet demands. 

- Automatic scaling is called Elasticity, and enables Azure to scale resources without interaction. 

### High Availability
- High Availability describes a system that is available for use without significant outages and that is generally backed by a service level agreement. 

### Fault Tolerance
- Fault tolerance is a characteristic that enables it to continue functioning when one or more components of the system fails. 

- Fault tolerance generally comes into play when a single resource fails. 

### Disaster Recovery
- Disaster recovery refers to the process of recovering from a situation where multiple systems or services fail.

- There is no right answer for a disaster recovery strategy, and it is very much situational and tied to you business continuity needs and defined by the IT services you provide.
